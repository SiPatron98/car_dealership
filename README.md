# Car dealership
This project is a webapp built in Spring Boot Framework using Spring Data JPA and Spring Web MVC. In this app we can buy a new car and make a service request when we have a problem with our car. I used postgres as a database in this project.
App was written during programming workshops organized by zajavka.pl
